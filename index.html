       step for step right now.</p>
    <p>I've downloaded both the extensions and now i'm just trying out different things.</p>
    <p>Been trying out Git and made a github account just now.</p>
    <p>I think i understand how github works but git is almost beyond me.</p>
    <p>Just sent my github link to M in Microsoft Teams.</p>
